# ✈️ Flight Ping

**Flight Ping** is a personal desktop application inspired by my lifelong passion for planes and aviation. I’ve always loved watching aircraft from my window, admiring them as they pass overhead — and that passion has become the driving force behind this project.

## 🌍 What is Flight Ping?

Flight Ping is a desktop app that **notifies you when a plane enters your local airspace**, specifically within a **5 km radius** of your current location.

It shows you:

* 🛫 **Flight number**
* 🏷️ **Airline name**
* 🌐 **Departure and destination airports**
* ✈️ **Aircraft type** (e.g., Jumbo jet or small aircraft)

Whenever a plane flies into your zone, a notification will pop up on your desktop so you can look outside and enjoy the view — just like I do!

## 🎯 Why I Built This

> I’ve always dreamed of becoming a pilot, but due to my hearing impairment and a failed medical test, I had to pivot.
>
> Rather than give up on aviation, I decided to build something that keeps me close to the skies. Flight Ping is my way of staying connected to what I love — watching aircraft, identifying their types, and feeling the joy every time one flies by.

## 📡 APIs Used

* [`aviationstack`](https://aviationstack.com/)

**Note:** Free API plans have rate limits, so performance is limited by request quotas. This was one of the biggest challenges while building the app.
